**Campus Projects and Outreach Committee (CPO)** is HCURA’s primary presence on Harvard’s campus. Through an array of on-campus initiatives, we hope to both promote research on campus and create a strong community of student researchers among Harvard’s undergraduate population. Programs like the Life Sciences Undergraduate Research Fair and HCURA Advising Program (HAP) both reach out to students interested in getting involved in research and expose current researchers to different fields outside their own.

Co-chairs:  Humphrey Obuobi '18 and Tina Huang '18

**Business and Career Development (BCD) Committee** is responsible for all of HCURA’s sponsorship and finance related endeavors. The committee works to establish and maintain relationships with both faculty and corporate sponsors, from Harvard’s graduate schools to Fortune 500 companies. In addition, we coordinate a career fair for our sponsors at the annual National Collegiate Research Conference, as well as company tours for our constituency. Apart from sponsorships, BCD manages all finances for the organization, including large annual budgets for the National Collegiate Research Conference and HCURA’s day-to-day operations.

**Brevia** is the official publication of the Harvard College Undergraduate Research Association. We publish in print once per semester and online more frequently. Our overarching goal is to be a forum for science, culture and other big ideas. We are committed to bringing all disciplines of research out of the ivory tower and into the discourse of the interested public. Through our opinion, features, and primary research articles, we explore the myriad connections in the world of intellectual endeavor. Our stories are brief because we want to make knowledge accessible and interesting, providing a palette of perspectives on the world around us.
