**Who is HSRC really for?**

Any high school sophomore, junior, or senior who has demonstrated a substantial interest in the sciences. That doesn’t mean that you have to have cured cancer or won a Nobel prize, but it does mean that you should be able to show us that you are truly interested in science beyond simply taking your required Biology and Physics classes in school. We in particular are looking for students who hope to pursue science in college and beyond, or who are considering pursuing science in the future, but who aren’t completely sure. Additionally, we especially welcome applications from students of minority backgrounds.

**I’m a freshman, but I really like science. Can I apply?**

Unfortunately, HSRC is only open to sophomores, juniors, and seniors.

**How competitive is the application for HSRC?**

Competitive but not ridiculously competitive. You don’t need to have won competitions such as Intel STS, Siemens, National Physics Bowl, or USA Biology Olympiad to be accepted, but many students have participated in science extracurricular activities such as the ones listed above in their high school in some form or another—whether that means membership in a science club or research in a bioengineering lab. Hopefully, however, after our conference, you will be encouraged to participate in more science activities!

**HSRC is the Harvard Science Research Conference. Do I need prior research experience?**

Not at all! HSRC is for students with research experience and students without research experience alike. All that you need is an open mind, a sincere passion for science, and a genuine desire to learn. You will also, notably, not be disadvantaged in the application process in any way if you have not had prior research experience.

**Why should I be interested in HSRC?**

Because you like science, and Harvard can offer you an inspiring day of learning about science from various different people and in many different forms that isn’t available anywhere else. See our pages on “Mission” and “Programming” for specific details.

**What are the components of the application? How does the process work?**

The application is very simple- you can find the form under “Apply.” It only involves some providing some personal information, a two short answer responses that you can answer in a two to three paragraphs, and a short list of activities and awards. You’re also welcome to provide any research that you’ve done in the past, but it's not necessary. Best of all, we don't require any essays!

***EXTENDED DEADLINE: Applications are due on Saturday, November 28 at 11:59 PM, and decisions will be released via email no later than the subsequent Monday.***


**How much does HSRC cost?**

Although we try very hard to make HSRC as inclusive as possible, the economic reality is that it costs money to run a conference where we bring in Harvard professors, researchers, and students for an entire day, so there is an $85 participation fee for the conference. However, we are proud to say that we do NOT charge an application fee, so please do not feel discouraged from applying. Additionally, we will provide free lunch to all participants as well as a free HSRC t-shirt.

**Do I need to bring anything?**

No! This a conference where you will learn by doing and experiencing. You will receive one-on one mentoring as well as participate in interactive workshops. We will provide all and any materials that you’ll need. In addition, we’ll give you lunch.

**How do I get to Harvard University?**

All events will occur at the Student Organization Center at Hilles (SOCH) at Harvard University. The address is the following:
59 Shepard Street
Cambridge, MA  02138

All participants will be expected to provide their own transportation to the conference.
