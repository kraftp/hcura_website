Missed our intro meeting?

Came to our intro meeting, but miss us already?

Join us this Saturday for a HCURA social! Eat great food, meet other students in HCURA, and ask any questions that you have about research at Harvard.

This is also a great opportunity to learn more about the HCURA Advising Program, which will kick off in early October.

We hope to see you there!
