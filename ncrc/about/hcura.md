The **Harvard College Undergraduate Research Association (HCURA)** was founded in 2007 upon the mission of building an interdisciplinary research community among Harvard undergraduates. This goal remains unchanged and we are thrilled with how the undergraduate research community has expanded in the past few years.

Our goal to increase the scope and visibility of Harvard undergraduate research is the focus of our many on-campus initiatives, including the **Peer Advising Program**, where upperclassmen introduce freshmen to undergraduate research at Harvard (160+ advisers and advisees); The **Visitas Undergraduate Research Symposium**, which showcases Harvard undergraduate research to prefrosh (~150 attendees); and The **Life Sciences Undergraduate Research Fair**, which presents physical sciences research to freshman looking for labs (100+ labs represented).

We’re committed to expanding the visibility and scope of undergraduate research on campus and beyond. Toward this goal, we’re excited to introduce several new projects such as **Brevia**, a publication for short research articles that presents a nontechnical treatment of cutting-edge research at Harvard.

Every January, we host the **National Collegiate Research Conference (NCRC) at Harvard** as a continuation of our vision to provide the best platform for undergraduates from across the nation to share their research. This year’s conference will feature distinguished speakers, panelists, and student presenters. Student participants will also have the opportunity to present their research through poster and plenary sessions.
