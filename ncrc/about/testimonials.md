“As I write this today, I just completed a successful summer research project at the Moskowitz lab -Department of Pediatrics, Massachusetts General Hospital/ Harvard Medical School. It all started at the National Collegiate Research Conference (NCRC) at Harvard College. Like many attendees, all I really expected to do was to present my research, meet a few new people, explore Boston and get on the next flight back to school. While I came prepared to interact with new people, I did not anticipate anything beyond that. Well, NCRC had more much in store for me….

At Harvard, I met Dr. Samuel Moskowitz, an exceptional physician researcher and clinician. I was really excited about his work and we engaged in a lively conversation and exchanged emails. He later invited me as visiting student to his lab. My project involved a “Genetic analysis of polymyxin resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Cystic Fibrosis patients.” What I loved the most was that I worked with a team who required excellence from me, but still maintained an infectious sense of humor and optimism. I learned something new each day.

My perspective on biomedical research changed significantly. Research is often portrayed as a lonely pursuit in which individuals spend long hours in isolation inside laboratories trying to figure out ‘impossible’ stuff. Based on my experience, this could not be farther from the truth. We collaborated at almost every stage; while learning new lab techniques, sharing insights from recent peer reviewed literature, during journal club and at weekly meetings. Looking back, I can confidently say it all began when I chose to attend NCRC at Harvard. I hope you that you will explore all the opportunities that NCRC has to offer. Remember, it’s always fun!”

“Interdisciplinarity gets plenty of lip service, but at NCRC it really is the main event. Watching an ethnomusicology student present her research while three feet away a cell biology researcher presented her project, I saw how bringing together distant fields of study underscores the common goal: a search for understanding. Building an interdisciplinary research community doesn’t just foster academic intellectualism; it fosters humanism.”

“Overall, I’m very impressed that undergrads had organized all of this. It must have been a lot of work for only students to put together. I think the HCURA staff were extremely kind, helpful, and professional and I would recommend this conference to others.”

“I simply cannot thank you enough for the tremendous effort you have put into making this conference a reality. I am completely blown away by the incredible quality of every aspect of the conference, and I am even more awestruck that the conference was put on entirely by undergraduates. I have been raving about this conference ever since I left. In more detail: 1) The keynote speakers were phenomenal. As a physicist I was honored to have such a notable speaker (Lewin) and I am certain that all of the other speakers are equally great researchers in their respective fields. Bravo for getting such amazing people to speak to us! 2) The dorm housing option was excellent. My host was one of the kindest and most considerate people I have ever met. The experience of living in a Harvard dorm was one-of-a-kind (dorms at my university are more like prison cells) and I feel very privileged to have had this experience. 3) As I mentioned before, the poster and plenary sessions had some of the best research presentations that I have ever seen. I learned a phenomenal amount about a wide breadth of fields, and others’ questions about my poster gave me excellent feedback on my work as well. Thank you very much for your hard work and phenomenal accomplishment. You guys are the best!”

“NCRC was a great experience! I learned a lot and met really interesting people. Listening to plenary sessions and the keynotes was highly educational and very special.”

“This is a fantastic conference. Great way to present you research, as well as getting an insight of what other is doing from all disciplines form English literature, to engineering.”

“If you’re interested in research and have started exploring research opportunities yourself – no matter your class rank – go to this conference! This conference will inspire you to do more and show you that there are more opportunities to do what you love and that you aren’t alone in this community; you all support each other!”

“NCRC is a great opportunity to connect with other undergraduates who are conducting research in your own field or even in fields that you never even considered. You will learn so much and be inspired by the high quality of undergraduate research that you will see.”

“Not only did I meet amazing faculty at NCRC, but amazing peers as well. NCRC provided me the opportunity to get closer to my research, in addition to others research, while making close friends in the process.”

“The NCRC was a memorable experience where the nation’s top undergraduate scientists came together from various fields to share their research. It was a truly humbling 3 days for me, and through this conference, I’ve made many new friends and memories. If you want to meet the best of the best, this is where they gather.”

“The NCRC was undoubtedly the best research experience I have ever had. Not only did I have an opportunity to discuss fascinating research projects with some of the top undergraduate researchers from around the US, but I also had an opportunity to discuss my work one-on-one with Harvard faculty. Between listening to excellent student research presentations, exploring downtown Boston, and listening to world-renowned professors give keynote talks there is nothing more that can be asked for. The NCRC is the best undergraduate research experience out there.”
