**The National Collegiate Research Conference (NCRC)** is a platform for undergraduates from across the nation to share their interest in research. The Harvard College Undergraduate Research Association (HCURA) strongly believes that student researchers have the ability to make meaningful and significant contributions in all fields of study and to the greater body of world research knowledge. Students are not only engaging in research earlier in their careers, but they are also participating in increasing numbers. In light of this positive growth, we have identified the urgent need for a cohesive undergraduate research community.

NCRC promotes the growth of a national undergraduate research community by facilitating communication, collaboration, and identity for undergraduate students in the global research sphere.

**Collaboration:** Networking at NCRC provides students with opportunities to form connections with both Harvard faculty and peers with a shared interest in research. NCRC challenges the traditional barriers to undergraduate research collaboration, such as institutional boundaries and lack of established precedent, through networking sessions, panels, poster sessions and keynote addresses.

**Communication:** NCRC enables students to present their research in a professional setting through poster and oral presentations. The exchange of ideas through a common interest in research is the foundation of a successful national research community.

**Identity:** NCRC acknowledges that student researchers are motivated by a fundamental pursuit of knowledge. Weaving new connections in a larger group that shares this same motivation is not just empowering – it is integral to success in the increasingly collaborative world of research. NCRC prepares young researchers for the future by bringing students together with a purpose – the betterment of our world through a common pursuit of knowledge.

The National Collegiate Research Conference (NCRC) will bring together a host of budding minds and established researchers to expand upon this theme in a three-day dialogue that will address the challenges and opportunities that face participants in the current research environment. How can we apply techniques developed for modeling neural networks more broadly? What crucial questions lie at the juncture between economics and history, or between chemistry and statistics? The future of how we explore our world through research will hinge on our answers to some of these vital questions.
