#### Robert Gallo

Robert Gallo is globally-recognized for his pioneering discovery of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as the agent responsible for AIDS. He has developed blood tests to screen for AIDS, created therapies to increase the lifespan of AIDS patients, made breakthroughs in slowing AIDS with chemical compounds. In addition to his work on AIDS, Dr. Gallo was the first to discover a human retrovirus, the only known cancer-causing human leukemia virus (HTLV), and an interleukin compound now used to treat cancer.

Robert Gallo served as the head of the Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology for three decades at the NIH’s National Cancer Institute and has published nearly 1,300 papers. He is also a co-founder of the biotechnology company Profectus BioSciences, Inc. He has won over 80 awards, including two Lasker Prizes, the most prestigious American award in biomedical research, the American Cancer Society’s Medal of Honor, the Griffuel prize from the Association for Cancer Research. Between 1981 and 1990, he was the most cited scientist and was ranked third globally for scientific impact between 1983 and 2002. Robert Gallo is currently director and co-founder of The Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.

#### Laurie Santos

Laurie Santos is a Professor of Psychology at Yale University and conducts research exploring the human mind and cognitive ability through an evolutionary perspective. Her studies of non-human primates answer the questions: How are non-human primates similar to humans in irrationality--or more specifically, biased decisionmaking? What are the cognitive abilities unique to the human mind? How do primates perceive and group objects in the physical world? Do primates have a theory of mind? Her Comparative Cognition Laboratory at Yale looks closely at human-like behaviors such as jealousy, judgment, financial irrationality, and frustration. She has been featured in TEDGlobal, Big Think, The New York Times, The Economist, The New Yorker, and NOVA, and was named by Popular Science Magazine as a “Brilliant 10 Young Minds.” Her numerous awards include Harvard University’s George W. Geothals Award for Teaching Excellence, Yale University’s Arthur Greer Memorial Prize for Outstanding Junior Faculty, and the Stanton Prize from the Society for Philosophy and Psychology for her important contributions to interdisciplinary research.

#### Stephen Wolfram

Stephen Wolfram is the creator of the popular computational software program Mathematica as well as knowledge search engine, Wolfram&#124;Alpha. As founder and CEO of Wolfram Research, Stephen Wolfram is pioneering computational science, providing increasingly more useful tools in scientific and technological innovation.

As a boy, Stephen Wolfram wrote his first book on particle physics at the age of 14. In his early teens, he published widely-cited papers in journals such as Nuclear Physics, Nuovo Cimento, and Physical Review. At the age of 20, he received his PhD in theoretical physics at Caltech, at which he became a faculty member, winning a MacArthur “Genius” grant a few years later for his work in physics and computing. Drawing inspiration from his work on cellular automata, Stephen Wolfram has introduced new ways of thinking in his book A New Kind of Science. Stephen Wolfram is a fellow of the American Mathematical Society. He is now cited by over 30,000 research publications and has featured his cutting-edge ideas at the global TED conference.

#### John Mather

Dr. John C. Mather is a Senior Astrophysicist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, where he specializes in infrared astronomy and cosmology. He received his Bachelor’s degree in physics at Swarthmore College and his PhD in physics at the University of California at Berkeley.

As an NRC postdoctoral fellow at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (New York City), he led the proposal efforts for the Cosmic Background Explorer (74-76), and came to GSFC to be the Study Scientist (76-88), Project Scientist (88-98), and the Principal Investigator for the Far IR Absolute Spectrophotometer (FIRAS) on COBE. He and his team showed that the cosmic microwave background radiation has a blackbody spectrum within 50 parts per million, confirming the Big Bang theory to extraordinary accuracy.
The COBE team also discovered the cosmic anisotropy (hot and cold spots in the background radiation), now believed to be the primordial seeds that led to the structure of the universe today. It was these findings that led to Dr. Mather receiving the Nobel Prize in 2006.

Dr. Mather now serves as Senior Project Scientist (95-present) for the James Webb Space Telescope, the successor to the great Hubble Space Telescope.

#### Xiao-Li Meng

Xiao-Li Meng is the Dean of the Harvard University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS), the Whipple V. N. Jones Professor at Harvard University, and previous Chair of the Statistics Department. As a prominent academic known for not only his visions as an administrator but also as a successful researcher in the field of statistics, Xiao-Li Meng has contributed more than 120 publications in areas ranging from statistical methods and computations to applications in engineering and medical sciences as well as in professional development. In 2001, he received the COPSS President’s Award in recognition for his outstanding contributions in the field of statistics. He has also made contributions as an editor for the journals Bayesian Analysis and Statistical Sinica. In 1982, he received his BS from Fudan University before receiving his PhD in statistics at Harvard in 1990. Now, he is a fellow of the Institute of Statistical Sciences as well as the American Statistical Association.


#### Alfred Spector

Alfred Spector is Vice President of Research for Google. Before his current position at Google, Alfred Spector held the title of Vice President of Services and Software Research at IBM. He was an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, and through his experience with distributed computing, Alfred Spector co-founded Transarc Corporation, which pioneered distributed transaction processing. In 2001, he was a recipient of the IEEE Computer Society’s Tsutsomu Kanai Award for his contributions to distributed computing systems. Alfred Spector is now a member of the National Academy of Engineering, a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a Fellow of the Association of Computing Machinery. Alfred Spector received a B.A. in Applied Mathematics from Harvard College, and then received his PhD in Computer Science at Stanford University, where his dissertation was on multiprocessing architectures for local computer networks.
