<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Research/Careers in the Humanities</strong></span>

Come learn about pursuing a research career in the humanities.

<b>Maria Polinsky</b>

My work is at the intersection of theoretical syntax and study of cross-linguistic variation in sentence structure. I am interested in the ways linguistic theory can be used as a roadmap for understanding how people process language and for obtaining meaningful results that feed back into theory. Language-wise, I specialize in Austronesian and languages of the Caucasus. I also have a particular interest in heritage languages which are strikingly similar to each other, regardless of the input (baseline) language. It is important to understand why they share so many grammatical similarities with each other. In terms of linguistic phenomena, I am particularly interested in long-distance dependencies, case assignment, and control/raising.

<b>Alexander Rehding</b>

Rehding spent many years at the other Cambridge (BA, MA, MPhil, PhD) and held research fellowships at Emmanuel College Cambridge, the Penn Humanities Forum and the Princeton Society of Fellows before joining the Harvard Department in 2003.

<b>Loren Walensky</b>

Loren D. Walensky, MD, PhD is an Associate Professor of Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, Principal Investigator and Pediatric Oncology Attending Physician in the Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Children’s Hospital Boston, Medical Director of Dana-Farber’s Linde Program in Cancer Chemical Biology, and Director of the Harvard/MIT MD-PhD Program. He serves as an adjunct faculty member in the Department of Cancer Biology at Dana-Farber and is affiliated with the graduate programs in Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, and Chemical Biology at Harvard Medical School.

Dr. Walensky’s research focuses on the chemical biology of deregulated apoptotic and transcriptional pathways in cancer and other human diseases. The goal of his laboratory is to develop an arsenal of new compounds-a “chemical toolbox”-to investigate and block pathologic protein interactions. To achieve these objectives, his group takes a multidisciplinary approach that employs synthetic chemistry techniques, structural biology analyses, and biochemical, cellular, and mouse modeling experiments to systematically dissect the signaling pathways of interest.  Dr. Walensky’s team has applied chemical strategies for generating highly specific and stable “stapled peptides” that preserve the structure of biologically active peptides, maximizing their potential as therapeutic reagents and as novel tools to elucidate biological pathways in normal and diseased tissues. In attacking clinically-relevant research challenges using a cache of techniques drawn from diverse basic disciplines, Dr. Walensky has broken new ground in our understanding of the protein interactions that govern the critical balance between cellular life and death, and is providing new pharmacologic strategies to target them.

Dr. Walensky is the recipient of numerous prestigious awards including a Stand Up to Cancer Innovative Research Grant, an NIH Director’s Transformative RO1 Award, the Society of Pediatrics Young Investigator Award, an American Society of Hematology Junior Faculty Scholar Award, a Burroughs Wellcome Career Award in the Biomedical Sciences, a Harvard Medical School Young Mentor Award, and most recently, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute’s Morse Award for Research Excellence and the Samuel Rosenthal Prize for Excellence in Academic Pediatrics.

Dr. Walensky graduated as valedictorian from Princeton University in 1990, majoring in Chemistry and receiving a Certificate in Science Policy from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. He went on to receive his MD and PhD from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 1997, having focused his graduate studies on signal transduction in the laboratory of Solomon Snyder, M.D.  Dr. Walensky trained in pediatrics at the Boston Combined Residency Program in Pediatrics. He completed a fellowship in pediatric hematology/oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Children’s Hospital Boston, joined the faculty as Instructor of Pediatrics in 2003, and founded his independent research laboratory in 2006.  His postdoctoral research studies that led to the development of bioactive stapled peptides as both powerful research tools and prototype therapeutics were jointly mentored by Gregory Verdine, Ph.D. of Harvard University and the late Stanley Korsmeyer, M.D. of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Dr. Walensky’s research contributed to the founding of Aileron Therapeutics, a Cambridge, MA biotechnology company that conducted the first-in-man stapled peptide clinical trial in 2013.
