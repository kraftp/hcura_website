#### About

New at NCRC 2014! Are you interested in solving the world’s problems? Now is your chance to do so alongside the best research minds in the country. The Innovation Challenge event is a collaborative, engaging event that will take place across two days. You and fellow participants will refine macro-scale questions to frame more specific, tractable problems. Groups will then develop solutions to solve these challenges and present their proposals.

Students across diverse disciplines will tackle the some of the century’s most pressing problems:

*How might we translate new technology into global development?*

*How can we apply a natural system to the detection or prevention of disease?*

*How might we balance need for care and profit in healthcare?*

*How might the U.S. achieve energy independence?*

*How might we measure and improve the wellbeing of citizens in closed, autocratic countries?*

*What role can numbers play in the humanities?*

*How might we better communicate to our current generation learnings from the past in order to learn from history?*

*How might we balance the expansion of MOOCs and EdX with face-to-face interaction in classrooms?*
