**Can I apply if do not attend university in the United States?**

Yes! Unfortunately, we will not be able to reimburse your travel costs.

**Can I apply if I have recently graduated from college with an undergraduate degree?**

Recent college graduates may apply to and present their work at the conference but they will not be able to compete for prize money. In addition, slots are very limited for these participants.

**Can I apply if I don’t do research in fields like biology, chemistry and physics?**

Yes! We encourage students doing research in ANY field to apply to NCRC. This includes fields like history, political science, sociology, and music (not to mention many others!)

**Can I attend the conference but not participate as a plenary/poster presenter?**

Yes, we do allow for non-competitive participants to apply to and attend the conference. Please keep in mind that you would still be expected to engage in all other conference events and social activities. Due to the nature of our conference as a research-sharing space, slots are very limited for these participants.

**If I am accepted as a plenary presenter do I still have to present a poster?**

No, as a plenary presenter you will not present a poster. This also means you would not be competing for the poster competition prizes. You will, however, be speaking to a group of ~50-70 other participants via a PowerPoint presentation. Plenary speakers are awarded $150.00.

**I don’t think I can attend for all three days of the conference — should I still apply?**

All participants must attend all three days of the conference.

**Where will I be staying throughout the conference?**

Conference participants can stay with a Harvard student host for $30 or they can secure their own housing at one of the hotels nearby in Cambridge. Some possibilities are: Sheraton Commander, Harvard Square Hotel, Charles Hotel

**What is the weather like in Boston in January? What kind of clothes should I pack?**

Warm clothes! In previous years, Cambridge and Boston have always been quite snowy and very cold during the time of the conference (between 10°F and 30°F, plus wind chill). Don’t forget winter hats, gloves, scarves, boots, stockings (for girls), umbrellas! Please keep in mind that participants should be in business casual for the conference. We will have a coat room where you can store your outerwear during conference events.

**Will I be reimbursed for my travel costs?**

Only plenary speakers and keynote speakers are reimbursed for travel costs.
