#### About

Each year, the National Collegiate Research Conference hosts several panels and workshops designed to engage and develop each participant’s personal interests. From entrepreneurship to graduate school admissions, participants gain valuable knowledge and skills in these interactive panels and workshops.

#### NCRC 2013 Workshops

**Speaking**

Giving a speech to a class or presenting to a panel of judges or the media can indeed be a nerve-wracking experience: What if you forget your train of thought? What should you do if you pause for too long? Public speaking is an important skill both in academia and in the workplace, but it certainly takes time and practice to polish. In these Public Speaking Workshops, you will have the chance to build upon these skills and learn the tricks of the trade from leaders in the workforce as they teach you how to be confident, effectively convey your ideas, and give a strong presentation. Panelists will include Michael Skok, from North Bridge Venture Partners, Greg Llacer, Director of the Office of Postgraduate and National Fellowships at Harvard University, Keith Winstein, Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at MIT, and Naniette Coleman, Assistant Director of Government, Politics, International Relations, and Military Career Programming and Advising at Harvard University.

**Entrepreneurship**

The Entrepreneurship workshop, led by Michael Skok, will teach participants how to give effective pitches. As an experienced entrepreneur and venture capitalist, Mr. Skok will draw on his valuable experience on both sides of the aisle to teach the fundamentals of successful investor pitches. The Research Presentations workshop, led by Greg Llacer, will teach participants how to convey their scientific discoveries clearly. As the director of Harvard College Program for Research in Science and Engineering (PRISE), Greg Llacer will share his insights and experiences on presenting research to a larger audience. The Science and the Media workshop, led by Keith Winstein, will teach participants how to communicate with the media. Mr. Winstein will draw on his experiences as a reporter to discuss interactions between science and the press. In the humanities and social sciences workshop, Naniette Coleman will draw on her experiences as a professional public speaker and Assistant Director of Law and Government Advising at Harvard University to teach students how to give effective presentations in the humanities and social sciences.
