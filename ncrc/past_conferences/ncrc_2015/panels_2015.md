<h3>Panels: 1 PM</h3>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Grad School/Fellowships</b></span>

 A panel representing diverse perspectives, from administrative to student roles, will discuss graduate school, fellowships, and their application processes.

<b>Kenneth Skinner</b>

He earned his B.S. from Morehouse College in Atlanta, GA. At Morehouse, Kenneth participated in research opportunities such as MBRS-RISE, MARC U*STAR, and Leadership Alliance. Kenneth currently resides in Dunster House as a resident tutor.

<b>Cynthia Verba</b>
Cynthia Verba has long devoted her scholarship to the rich musical debates of the French Enlightenment, with many of the issues revolving around the composer-theorist Jean-Philippe Rameau, as both subject and participant in the debates. While her earlier book, Music and the French Enlightenment:  Reconstruction of a Dialogue, 1750-1765 (Oxford Clarendon Press, 1993), closely examines the nature of the arguments in the Rameau-centered debates, her current work shifts the emphasis to Rameau’s musical practice, focusing on his concept of musical expression and how it is manifested in his own tragedies.  Additional publications include a chapter in The Enlightenment World (Routledge Press, 2004), as well as articles and reviews in the Cambridge Opera Journal, Journal of the American Musicological Association, The Journal of Musicology, and the Journal of Modern History.  She has been a Fellow at the Bunting Institute of Radcliffe College and a recipient of a National Foundation for the Humanities Summer Grant.

Verba’s scholarly activities have their counterpart in her administrative activities at Harvard University, where she has served as Director of Fellowships in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences for the past two and a half decades.  During most of that time she also held a position as music lecturer in Harvard Extension, teaching courses in music history to a more general student body. She received her Ph.D. in music history from the University of Chicago and her B.A. from Vassar College.

<b>Kathleen Coleman</b>
Kathleen Coleman was born and raised in Zimbabwe, and has degrees from the Universities of Cape Town, Zimbabwe, and Oxford. Before coming to Harvard in 1998, where she is James Loeb Professor of the Classics, she was on the faculty at the University of Cape Town and Trinity College Dublin.

<b>Bernhard Nickel</b>
Bernhard Nickel is professor of philosophy in the philosophy department at Harvard University. He completed his Ph.D. at MIT in 2005 after graduating with a B.A. from Cornell University in 1999. He originally hails from Germany.
His research centers on the philosophy of language, where he is currently at work investigating the role of truth in meaning. He’s focusing on everyday generalizations about the world, some of which are harmless—ravens are black, tigers have stripes, things roll downhill—some of which are used to express some of our most controversial views about the ways our society works: stereotypes.

<b>Tom Conley</b>
Tom Conley, Abbott Lawrence Lowell Professor of Romance Languages and Visual and Environmental Studies, studies  literature, cinema and cartography from standpoints of history and theory.  Recent books include Cartographic Cinema (2007), An Errant Eye: Poetry and Topography in Early Modern France (2011), and À fleur de page: Voir et lire le texte de la Renaissance (forthcoming 2015).  He is co-editor of the Wylie-Blackwell Companion to Jean-Luc Godard ˆ(2014) and translator of works by Michel de Certeau, Gilles Deleuze and others.  In 2014 twenty-three students, peers and colleagues honored him with the publication of a Festschrift titled Illustrations inconscientes, écritures de la Renaissance (Paris, Éditions Classiques Garnier).
