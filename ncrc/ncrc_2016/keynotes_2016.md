####Jeffrey Friedman

Dr. Jeffrey Friedman is a physician scientist studying the genetic mechanisms that
regulate body weight. Dr. Friedman's research on various aspects of obesity received
national attention in late 1994, when it was announced that he and his colleagues had
isolated the mouse ob gene and its human homologue. They subsequently found that
injections of the encoded protein, leptin, decreases body weight of mice by reducing food
intake and increasing energy expenditure. Current research is aimed at understanding the
genetic basis of obesity in human and the mechanisms by which leptin transmits its weightreducing
signal.
He is currently a Professor at the Rockefeller University, an Investigator at the Howard
Hughes Medical Institute and the Director of the Starr Center for Human Genetics. Dr.
Friedman's affiliation with The Rockefeller University began in 1980, where he was awarded
a Ph.D. degree in 1986. He was appointed Assistant Investigator with the Howard Hughes
Medical Institute at Rockefeller in 1986, promoted to Associate Investigator in 1991, and
Investigator in 1997. Dr. Friedman received an MD. degree from Albany Medial College in
1977 and completed a medical residency at Albany Medical College in 1980.
Dr. Friedman was born in Orlando, Florida, on July 20, 1954, and grew up in North
Woodmere, Long Island. He graduated from Renssalaer Polytechnic Institute magna cum
laude and, at the age of 22, received his medical degree from Albany medical College of
Union University in Albany, New York. While at Albany Medical College, he was elected to
Alpha Omega Alpha, the medical honor society. After completing a residency in Internal
Medicine at Albany Medical Center Hospital, Dr. Friedman came to Rockefeller as a
postgraduate fellow and associate physician in 1980. From 1980 to 1981, he also served as
a postgraduate fellow at Cornell University Medical College. In 1986, he received a Ph.D.
under the tutelage of Professor James E. Darnell, was appointed assistant professor, and
became an assistant investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Dr. Friedman was
appointed Professor at Rockefeller in 1995 after serving as Associate Professor and Head of
Laboratory of Molecular Genetics at the Institution since 1991 and in 1998 awarded the
Marilyn M. Simpson Professorship. In 1995 he was appointed Director of the Starr
Foundation Center for Human Genetics.

#### Alexander Kamb

Alexander Kamb has almost two decades of experience in the biotechnology sector (including founder of one company) and the biopharmaceutical industry.  He specializes in genetics, structural biology, neuroscience and oncology.  He has published widely in these areas with nine peer-reviewed papers in the Science and Nature journals, including the most highly cited scientific publication of 1994.

Dr. Kamb received his A.B. from Harvard University and his Ph.D. from Caltech.  His thesis work culminated in the molecular cloning and characterization of the first potassium channel gene (Shaker locus in D. melanogaster), one of the fundamental determinants of electrical excitability in the nervous system (Kamb et al., Cell 1987; Kamb et al., Neuron 1988).  

As a postdoctoral fellow at UCSF with Harold Varmus and Robert Stroud, Dr. Kamb invented an extremely rapid and broadly applicable method for cloning gene family members (Kamb et al., PNAS 1989).  He used this method to identify human potassium channel genes as well as genes in model organisms which are involved in development (e.g., C. elegans Wnt).  During his postdoctoral work he also solved crystal structures for the cancer drug target thymidylate synthase (Kamb et al., Biochemistry 1992a; Kamb et al., Biochemistry 1992b).

In 1992 he became the third employee at a startup company called Myriad Genetics, focused on identification and commercialization of human disease genes/diagnostics.  During the next few years, he led the Myriad teams that cloned the major familial breast cancer genes, BRCA1 (Miki et al., Science 1994) and BRCA2 (Tavtigian et al., Nature Genetics 1996), and the major familial melanoma susceptibility and multiple tumor suppressor gene CDKN2 (Kamb et al., Science 1994).  All these genes were commercialized by Myriad as proprietary diagnostic tests.

He founded a biotechnology company in 1996 (Arcaris), specializing in somatic cell genetics, which was sold in 2003, whereupon he joined Novartis as Global Head of Oncology.   In 2006, Dr. Kamb joined Amgen to direct oncology research at their South San Francisco site.  In 2007 he took over the leadership of the Neurosciences Therapeutic Area. In February 2010 he was promoted to Vice President, Research, Neuroscience.  In 2010 he also established a new, independent group within Amgen Research called the Genome Analysis Unit, focused on cross-therapeutic-area strategic deployment of ultra-high-throughput DNA sequencing technology.  In 2011 he was promoted to Senior Vice President, and currently heads Amgen’s entire discovery research organization (~1000 FTEs).


#### Robert Lue

Robert A. Lue is a professor in the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology and the Richard L. Menschel Faculty Director of the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning at Harvard University, where he is responsible for fostering innovative teaching in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) and elevating its profile on campus. Rob earned his Ph.D. in biology from Harvard and has taught undergraduate courses since 1988, garnering recognition as one of Harvard’s foremost leaders in undergraduate education.

Rob has a longstanding commitment to interdisciplinary teaching and research, and chaired the faculty committee that developed the first integrated science foundation in the country to serve multiple science majors as well as the needs of pre-medical students.

From 2004 to 2015, Rob served as the director of Life Sciences Education at Harvard, where he led a complete redesign of the introductory curriculum – creating some of the largest and most popular science courses on campus – that redefined how Harvard can more effectively foster new generations of scientists as well as science-literate citizens.

A national figure in life sciences education, Rob co-leads the National Academies Summer Institute on Scientific Teaching at Harvard and has co-authored several undergraduate biology textbooks. His scientific multimedia projects have received numerous awards for their scientific accuracy, educational utility, and vibrant 3-D portrayals of the cellular world. In 2012, Rob’s extensive work on using technology to enhance learning took a new direction when he became the faculty director of HarvardX, Harvard’s university-wide initiative that includes the edX partnership in online education with MIT. At HarvardX, Rob helps to shape Harvard’s engagement in online learning in a way that reinforces its commitment to teaching excellence and works to expand its reach and impact globally.

As the faculty director of the Harvard Ed Portal, Rob oversees the integration of undergraduate education with community outreach on Harvard’s Allston campus, bringing together Harvard and the Allston-Brighton community to share the excitement of learning. He also has a long history in pre-college education, and consequently founded and directs the Harvard Life Sciences Outreach program, which serves over fifty high schools across Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island.
