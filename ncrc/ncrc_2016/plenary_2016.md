<b>Martin Carlino</b>

Martin Carlino is a proud native of Long Island and a senior at Harvard College, concentrating in Government with a focus on political theory and American history. He is currently writing his thesis, which examines the evolution of American executive power beginning with the formation of the Constitution from the raw material of Enlightenment thinking and culminating in the crucible of civil war. The figure of Abraham Lincoln has long been his role model and academic muse, and Martin is excited to be giving his first ever talk on the 16th president and the crisis through which he guided the nation. In his free time, Martin enjoys running, cooking, gardening, listening to Frank Sinatra and 90s hip hop, and playing Dungeons & Dragons, though usually not all at once. He has absolutely no idea what he’s doing with his life after graduation, and is convulsed by existential angst whenever anyone asks him.

<b>James Lawniczak</b>

James Lawniczak is a Chemistry and Mathematics junior at the University of Michigan interested in solar energy, organometallic catalysis, bioinformatics, chemistry education, and Polish culture. In the Sanford Lab at the University of Michigan, James is developing a novel reaction involving selective functionalization of C-H bonds on amines, which has direct applications to the synthesis of important classes of pharmaceuticals. Previously, he has researched solar energy storage in the Nocera Lab at Harvard as part of the Harvard-Amgen Scholars Program, and developed software for analyzing bioinformatics data in the Martin Lab at the University of Michigan. Starting last year, he has been teaching a supplementary discussion section for organic chemistry at his university. In the future, he would like to develop green chemistry approaches to make important reactions more environmentally friendly. He plans to complete a Ph.D. in organometallic chemistry and ultimately lead a research group as a professor.


<b>Andrew Saydjari</b>

Raised in central Wisconsin, Andrew began his career in chemistry by journeying to the East Coast in order to work on materials chemistry at the Naval Research Lab in Washington, D.C. He published his first two papers while still in high school on imperative spectroscopic corrections to account for Fabry-Perot interferences in thin films and the first electrochemical deposition/characterization of bromophenol blue on a gold substrate. In addition to chemistry, he has a penchant for physics and math which drives his interdisciplinary approach to research—frequently spreading him between multiple lab groups. Currently, Andrew is pursuing both a B.S./M.S. in Chemistry and a B.S. in Math at Yale University and is preforming terahertz spectroscopy research in the Schmuttenmaer group. However, Andrew not only loves to research and learn, but also to teach. An aspiring professor, he is a dedicated tutor and volunteers his weekends to create and teach classes to New Haven high school students through SPLASH@Yale (the most recent entitled, “Abstract Algebra: Questions Teachers Refused to Answer in High School”). For Andrew, the highest good is the asking and answering of questions—learning and knowledge consists solely in this.
